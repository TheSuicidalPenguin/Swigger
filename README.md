# Swigger

## Description
Swigger, or **Swagger Endpoint Filter**, allows users to specify a list of API endpoints, and it generates a filtered JSON object containing only those endpoints from the Swagger documentation. This helps in managing and sharing a subset of API documentation without exposing unnecessary details.
